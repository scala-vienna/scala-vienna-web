[Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/) (“Scala Language-Integrated Connection Kit”) is Typesafe‘s Functional Relational Mapping (FRM) library for Scala that makes it easy to work with relational databases. It allows you to work with stored data almost as if you were using Scala collections, while at the same time giving you full control over when a database access happens and which data is transferred. 

The third major release brings it to a new level. It provides the new DBIO type for nicely sequencing your database actions, streaming results through [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/), and an asynchronous interface on top of the blocking JDBC API with clever threading and connection pool management. 

After a brief introduction and overview, we will explore the API through some code examples.
