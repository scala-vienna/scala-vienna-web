* Common pitfalls and problems with Threads, JVM concurrency and background about the Java Memory Model, how locking works, etc. 
* Going from a threading model based (directly) on ThreadPools to one based on Akka by addressing contention issues along the way (or "why don't I just use thread pools?")
* talk I forgot to mention, if you're interested in JVM concurrency, watch out for anything that Heinz Kabutz posts! :) For example, <https://2013.con-fess.com/sessions/-/details/74/The-Secrets-of-Concurrency>
