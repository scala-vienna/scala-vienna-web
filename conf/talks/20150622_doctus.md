Wolfgang will explain the core concepts of [Doctus](http://entelijan.net/art/doctus/) and do some live coding. Doctus is a Scala library for the creation of visual art pieces. It is based on the ideas of [Processing](https://processing.org/) but uses Scala as a programming language. Projects can create images on multiple platforms. Currently Swing and HTML5-Canvas are supported.
