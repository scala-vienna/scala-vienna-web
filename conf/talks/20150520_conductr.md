Running multiple (micro-)services on multiple nodes in a cluster, in a fail-safe way, scaling them, and updating them, can be a challenge for the operations or devops teams. [Typesafe ConductR](http://typesafe.com/products/conductr) has entered the arena to make things simpler: Build a bundle, load it into the ConductR cluster, tell it how many instances you want to run in parallel, done. I will give a very brief overview of ConductR, and a little live demo of ConductR in action.
